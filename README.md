## My process

### Built with üöÄ

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this JavaScript code, I learned how to:

- Use the forEach() method to iterate over a collection of elements and attach event listeners to each one.

- Use the getAttribute() method to get the value of a custom attribute on an HTML element.

- Use the async and await keywords to handle asynchronous operations with Promises.

- Use conditional statements (if/else) to control the flow of program execution based on specific conditions.

- Use the setTimeout() method to delay the execution of a function by a specified amount of time.

### Continued development

In my next projects I want to focus more on JavaScript üî•
